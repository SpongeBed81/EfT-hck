## Note
I am developing this project solely for the purpose of learning C++, and I don't think I am using the best practices yet. Any pull request will be greatly appreciated.

## What is Supangle?
Supangle is a JavaScript runtime powered by the Google's V8 engine. I am planning to add built-in support for TypeScript, standalone executables, low-level memory access through Supangle's APIs and much more. 

## Installation
I am not planning to provide executables yet until the project reaches a certain point.
